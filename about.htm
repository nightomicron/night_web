				<h1>About Me</h1>
				<p class="about_me">
					Dear visitor, my name is Balázs "Night" Pintér, a young hungarian who seeks to be a software and / or web developer.
					<br><br>
					I recently finished my studies of information technology at the University of Szeged in Hungary, and im currently looking for a job as a fresh graduate.
					I am interested in both back-end and front-end programming, in designing, in databases and also in testing.
					I speak both english and hungarian fluently and utilize both of them on a daily basis.
					I enjoy turning complex problems into simple solutions, while learning new ways of programming, scripting, designing to make the work faster and easier.
					<br><br>
					My goal is to become a professional software or / and web developer while extending my knowledge in this field, and I believe with the great motivation,
					hard work, and the neverending desire of learning, I will be able to achieve my goals in the close future.
					<br><br>
					My current knowledge and interests:
					<ul class="about_me">
						<li>Java</li>
						<li>JavaScript</li>
						<li>JQuery</li>
						<li>Angular JS</li>
						<li>HTML and CSS</li>
						<li>PHP</li>
						<li>MySQL</li>
						<li>Drupal</li>
						<li>Version Control: Git</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<br><br>
				<h1>This Website</h1>
				<p class="about_me">
					The website is part of my big, main project which will not only help me maintain my current level in developing but also will help me gain more and more knowledge, 
					routine, and experience. I will use this website to post my projects, like a personal "sourceforge" or portfolio while I keep creating more content.
					<br><br>
					The site itself was built with HTML, JavaScript - AngularJS and CSS stylesheets. So far it is semi-responsive.
					<br>
					Future goals:
					<ul class="about_me">
						<li>Full responsivity</li>
						<li>More content</li>
						<li>More style</li>
						<li>A guestbook</li>
						<li>A newsfeed</li>
					</ul>
					<br><br>
