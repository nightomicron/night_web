			<p>
				Dear visitor, my name is Balázs "Night" Pintér, a young hungarian who seeks to be a software or / and web developer.
				<br><br>
				I recently finished my studies of information technology at the University of Szeged in Hungary, and im currently looking for a job as a fresh graduate.
				I am interested in both back-end and front-end programming, in designing, in databases and also in testing.
				I speak both english and hungarian fluently, I use both of them on a daily basis, and also I am learning spanish.
				I enjoy building projects, learning new ways of programming, and turning complex problems into simple solutions.
				<br><br>
				My goal is to become a professional software or / and web developer while extending my knowledge of this field, and I believe with the great motivation,
				hard work, and the neverending desire of learning, I will be able to achieve my goals in the close future.
				<br><br>
				My current knowledge and interests:
				<ul>
					<li>Java</li>
					<li>JavaScript</li>
					<li>JQuery</li>
					<li>HTML and CSS</li>
					<li>PHP</li>
					<li>MySQL</li>
					<li>Drupal</li>
					<li>Version Control: Git</li>
				</ul>
				In the future I would like to learn Angular as well.
			</p>
			<h1 class="p_title">This Website</h1>
			<p>
				The website is part of my big, main project which will not only help me to maintain my current level in developing but also will help me to gain more and more knowledge, 
				routine, and experience. I will use this website to post my projects, like a personal "sourceforge" or portfolio while I keep creating more content.
				<br><br>
				It was built from scratch with my own fingers, using HTML, JavaScript - JQuery and various CSS stylesheets. Unfortunately it is not responsive YET, and it is adjusted to 
				1366 x 768 screen resolution as the minimum.
				<br>
				Future goals:
				<ul>
					<li>Responsivity</li>
					<li>More content</li>
					<li>More style</li>
					<li>A guestbook</li>
					<li>Function to enlarge the preview pictures</li>
					<li>A newsfeed</li>
				</ul>
