				<h1 id="project_desc">Description</h1>
				<p id="project_p">
					The royal game of ur is an ancient tabletop game. Both players have 5 pieces and they try to move their own pieces from the starting line to the finish line. 
					The game table has 3 areas. The left row is the first player's row, the second is the middle zone and the third one belongs to the second player. 
					<br><br>
					<b>Rules:</b>
					<br>
					The rules are simple. Both players throw the die in their turns and then they move one of the five pieces they desire. If a piece collides with another, the new one eats the old one. 
					This means the new piece remains on the field, and the old one gets returned to the owner. Be careful because your pieces can be eaten by your own pieces. In the middle zone 
					both of the players' pieces move on the same field which makes the progress even harder. Once a piece reaches the bottom, it enters the final section, the last two fields before the finish. 
					A piece can only cross the finish line if the score of the die matches the remaining fields. This means if your piece is 4 steps away from the finish, it can only cross it if you throw a 4. 
					If you throw a 5 in this case, your piece cant finish in that turn. Once a piece finishes, you are not able to use it anymore. It will become your trophy.
					<br><br>
					You win if all of your pieces finished the course successfully. Oh and I almost forgot to mention, if you touch a field that has a circle symbol, that means you get an extra turn. Have fun!
					<br><br>
					<b>Notes:</b>
					<br>
					With this project I wanted to practice canvas, it is one of my very first projects.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Known bugs:</b>
					<br>
					After the 1st player wins the game, the game will let the 2nd player do one more turn.<br>
					If the user moves or resizes the window, the board will fall apart due to the canvas.<br><br>
